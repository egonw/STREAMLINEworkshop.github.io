# Weighted gene coexpression analysis (WGCNA)
In this session you will learn how to apply WGCNA to your differential gene expression data in order to extract functional modules of co-expressed genes. You will need a functional, actual version of R with installed WGCNA package in order to follow the tutorial.

## Content
1. Introduction lecture (slides will become available after the session)
2. Hands-on [slides/code](https://github.com/fehrhart/STREAMLINEworkshop.github.io/blob/main/WGCNA.Rmd)
3. You will need the files:
   * [SraRunTable.txt](https://github.com/fehrhart/STREAMLINEworkshop.github.io/blob/main/SraRunTable.txt)
   * [normcounts.csv](https://github.com/fehrhart/STREAMLINEworkshop.github.io/blob/main/normcounts.zip) - this is a zipped (compressed) version!
