# (Multi) omics data visualisation
In this session you will learn how to visualise omics data from one or more (= "multi omics") sources in molecular pathways. You will need to have PathVisio software installed for this, including loaded identifier mapping databases and the WikiPathways plugin (see preparation). 

## Content
1. Hands-on tutorial with instructions can be found here: [Tutorial](https://github.com/fehrhart/STREAMLINEworkshop.github.io/blob/main/(Multi)%20omics%20data%20visualisation.docx)
2. The data needed for visualisation is the [DEG_F.txt](https://github.com/fehrhart/STREAMLINEworkshop.github.io/blob/main/DEG_F.txt) file from the RNAseq data analysis for single omics visualisation
3. For multiomics data visualisation we have created a file containing RNAseq data and metabolomics: [Multiomics.txt](https://github.com/fehrhart/STREAMLINEworkshop.github.io/blob/main/Multiomics.txt)

## More information
Our introductory demonstration is following this [basic](https://pathvisio.org/tutorials/visualization.html) and this [advanced tutorial](https://pathvisio.org/tutorials/multi-omics-tutorial.html) from the PathVisio homepage.
