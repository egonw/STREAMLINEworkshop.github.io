# From raw counts to differentially expressed genes using the DESeq2 R package
In this session we will start with raw counts of RNA sequencing data. For this tutorial we are re-using data from a previously published study by XX et al. The data is publicly available from GEO databases under accession number >>>.

## Content
1. Introductory lecture to the data processing steps done by DESeq2
2. Hands-on analysing the data to get from raw counts to differentially expressed genes

## Further reading
