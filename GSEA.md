# Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and overrepresentation analysis
In this session you will learn how to apply different methods of gene set enrichment and overrepresentation analyis. These methods investigate if there is a functionally related group of genes that are differentially expressed in your dataset and indicate affected biological processes or molecular pathways.
